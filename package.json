[ISXB-953](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-953)\n- Fixed Action Maps name edition which could be inconsistent in Input Action Editor UI.\n- Fixed InputDeviceTester sample only visualizing a given touch contact once. [ISXB-1017](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1017)\n- Fixed an update loop in the asset editor that occurs when selecting an Action Map that has no Actions.\n- Fixed Package compilation when Unity Analytics module is not enabled on 2022.3. [ISXB-996](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-996)\n- Fixed 'OnDrop' event not called when 'IPointerDownHandler' is also listened. [ISXB-1014](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1014)\n- Fixed InputSystemUIInputModule calling pointer events on parent objects even when the \"Send Pointer Hover To Parent\" is off. [ISXB-586](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-586)\n- Improved performance of disconnected device activation (ISX-1450)\n\n### Changed\n- Use `ProfilerMarker` instead of `Profiler.BeginSample` and `Profiler.EndSample` when appropriate to enable recording of profiling data.\n\n### Added\n- Added Hinge Angle sensor support for foldable devices.\n- Added InputDeviceMatcher.WithManufacturerContains(string noRegexMatch) API to improve DualShockSupport.Initialize performance (ISX-1411)\n- Added tests for Input Action Editor UI for managing action maps (List, create, rename, delete) (ISX-2087)\n- Added automatic loading of custom extensions of InputProcessor, InputInteraction and InputBindingComposite [ISXB-856]](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-856).\n- Added an IME Input sample scene."
