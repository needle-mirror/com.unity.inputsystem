[ISXB-766](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-766)\n- Fixed an issue when multiple interactions drive an action and perform during the cancelation of the current active interaction [ISXB-310](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-310).\n- Fixed an issue when generating C# class of Input Actions that contain an action map named `Debug` [ISXB-851](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-851).\n- Fixed ArgumentNullException thrown when accessing Action's bindings after changing Composite part. [ISXB-494](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-494).\n\n### Added\n- Added `InputSystemUIInputModule.scrollDeltaPerTick` property, a customizable multiplicative factor applied to the scroll wheel speed before it is sent to UI components. Note that this has no effect on UI Toolkit content, only uGUI."
