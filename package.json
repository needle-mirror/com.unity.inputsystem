    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Added warning messages to both `OnScreenStick` and `OnScreenButton` Inspector editors that would display a warning message in case on-screen control components are added to a `GameObject` not part of a valid UI hierarchy.\n- Changed behavior for internal feature flag relating to Windows Gaming Input to be ignored on non-supported platforms.\n- Changed `DualSenseHIDInputReport` from internal to public visibility\n\n### Fixed\n- Avoid potential crashes from `NullReferenceException` in `FireStateChangeNotifications`.\n- Fixed cases where `wasPressedThisFrame` would not return true if a press and release happened within the same frame before being queried (and vice versa for `wasReleasedThisFrame`).\n- Fixed an issue where a composite binding would not be consecutively triggered after ResetDevice() has been called from the associated action handler [ISXB-746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-746).\n- Fixed resource designation for \"d_InputControl\" icon to address CI failure.\n- Fixed an issue where a composite binding would not be consecutively triggered after disabling actions while there are action modifiers in progress [ISXB-505](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-505).\n- Fixed prefabs and missing default control scheme used by PlayerInput component are now correctly shown in the inspector [ISXB-818](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-818).\n- Fixed error thrown when Cancelling Control Scheme creation in Input Actions Editor.\n- Fixed Scheme Name in Control Scheme editor menu that gets reset when editing devices [ISXB-763](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-763).\n- Fixed an issue where `InputActionAsset.FindAction(string, bool)` would throw `System.NullReferenceException` instead of returning `null` if searching for a non-existent action with an explicit action path and using `throwIfNotFound: false`, e.g. searching for \"Map/Action\" when `InputActionMap` \"Map\" exists but no `InputAction` named \"Action\" exists within that map [ISXB-895](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-895).\n- Fixed scroll speed being slower when using InputSystemUIInputModule instead of StandaloneInputModule. (https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/ISXB-771)\n- Fixed an issue where adding a `OnScreenButton` or `OnScreenStick` to a regular GameObject would lead to exception in editor.\n- Fixed an issue where adding a `OnScreenStick` to a regular GameObject and entering play-mode would lead to exceptions being generated.\n- Fixed InputActionReference issues when domain reloads are disabled [ISXB-601](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-601), [ISXB-718](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-718), [ISXB-900](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-900)\n- Fixed a performance issue with many objects using multiple action maps [ISXB-573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-573).\n- Fixed an variable scope shadowing issue causing compilation to fail on Unity 2019 LTS.\n- Fixed an issue where changing `InputSettings` instance would not affect associated feature flags.\n- Submit and Cancel UI actions will now respect configured interactions. [ISXB-841](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-841).\n- Fixed the UI generation of enum fields when editing interactions of action properties. The new selected value was lost when saving.\n- Fixed the UI generation of custom interactions of action properties when it rely on OnGUI callback. [ISXB-886](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-886).\n- Fixed deletion of last composite part raising an exception. [ISXB-804](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-804)\n- Fixed an issue related to Visualizers sample where exceptions would be thrown by InputActionVisualizer and InputControlVisualizer when entering play-mode if added as components to a new `GameObject`.\n- Fixed an issue with InputAction Asset editor where invalid ControlScheme names with only spaces could be entered. [ISXB-547](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-547).\n\n### Added\n- Added additional device information when logging the error due to exceeding the maximum number of events processed\n  set by `InputSystem.settings.maxEventsBytesPerUpdate`. This additional information is available in development builds\n  only.\n- Fixed deletion of last composite part raising an exception. [ISXB-804](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-804)\n- Expanded editor and build insight analytics to cover ``.inputactions` asset editor usage, `InputSettings` and common component configurations.\n\n### Changed\n- Changed `DualSenseHIDInputReport` from internal to public visibility\n- Added Input Setting option allowing to keep platform-specific scroll wheel input values instead of automatically converting them to a normalized range."
