    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed Multiple interactions could breaks on Composite Binding. [ISXB-619](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-619)\n- Fixed memory leak when the OnScreenStick component was destroyed [ISXB-1070](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1070). Contribution by [LukeUnityDev](https://github.com/LukeUnityDev).\n- Fixed Action Maps contextual menu in Action Editor UI that occasionally displays unrelated items.\n- Fixed \"MissingReferenceException\" errors when closing an in-game dropdown field [ISXB-1081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1081).\n- Fixed potential crash on Mac when using stale references to deleted InputDevice objects [ISXB-606](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-606).\n- Fixed conditional compilation for non-editor analytics on platforms not enabling analytics.\n\n### Changed\n- Renamed editor Resources directories to PackageResources to fix package validation warnings.\n- Changed representation of GamepadButton enum values in Inspector to display aliased enum values as a single item to avoid confusion around selection and aliased value display when multiple enum items map to the same numerical value. [ISXB-543](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-543)\n- PlayerInput component now warns if the system cannot find matching control scheme, which can occur if all control schemes already paired (e.g. to other game objects with PlayerInput components) [ISXB-1020](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1020)"
