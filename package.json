    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue causing the Action context menu to not show on right click when right clicking an action in the Input Action Editor [ISXB-1134](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1134).\n- Reverted changes from 0ddd534d8 (ISXB-746) which introduced a regression [ISXB-1127](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1127).\n- Fixed `ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.` during the migration of Project-wide Input Actions from `InputManager.asset` to `InputSystem_Actions.inputactions` asset which lead do the lost of the configuration [ISXB-1105](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1105).\n- Fixed pointerId staying the same when simultaneously releasing and then pressing in the same frame on mobile using touch. [ISXB-1006](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-845).\n- Fixed ISubmitHandler.OnSubmit event processing when operating in Manual Update mode (ISXB-1141).\n- Fixed Rename mode is not entered and name is autocompleted to default when creating a new Action Map on 2022.3. [ISXB-1151](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1151).\n- Fixed unexpected control scheme switch when using `OnScreenControl` and pointer based schemes which registed \"Cancel\" event on every frame.[ISXB-656](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-656).\n- Fixed an issue with The \"Add Control Scheme...\" popup window so that it now persists until any changes are explicitly Saved or Cancelled [case ISXB-1131](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1131).\n- Fixed missing documentation for source generated Input Action Assets. This is now generated as part of the source code generation step when \"Generate C# Class\" is checked in the importer inspector settings.\n- Fixed pasting into an empty map list raising an exception. [ISXB-1150](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1150)\n- Fixed pasting bindings into empty Input Action asset. [ISXB-1180](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1180)\n- Fixed missing '&' symbol in Control Scheme dropdown on Windows platform. [ISXB-1109](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1109)\n- Fixed icon scaling in Input Actions window.\n- Fixed an issue where removing the InputSystem package could lead to invalid input handling settings.\n- Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when adding a new Control Scheme with any Device selected. [ISXB-1129](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1129)\n- Fixed a CS0105 compiler warning due to duplicate using statement in test source code (ISXB-1247).\n- Fixed tooltip support in the UI Toolkit version of the Input Actions Asset editor.\n- Fixed documentation to clarify bindings with modifiers `overrideModifiersNeedToBePressedFirst` configuration [ISXB-806](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-806).\n- Fixed an issue in `Samples/Visualizers/GamepadVisualizer.unity` sample where the visualization wouldn't handle device disconnects or current device changes properly (ISXB-1243).\n- Fixed an issue when displaying Serialized InputAction's Processor properties inside the Inspector window. [ISXB-1269](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1269)\n- Fixed an issue with default device selection when adding new Control Scheme.\n- Fixed an issue where action map delegates were not updated when the asset already assigned to the PlayerInput component were changed [ISXB-711](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-711).\n- Fixed Action properties edition in the UI Toolkit version of the Input Actions Asset editor. [ISXB-1277](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1277)\n- Fixed an editor crash caused by input debugger device state window reusing cached state when reconnecting Stadia controller. [ISXB-658](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-658)\n- Fixed an issue where batch jobs would fail with \"Error:"
