[ISXB-1155](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1155)\n- Fixed GamepadButton.LeftTrigger and GamepadButton.RightTrigger enum values not matching displayed dropdown values in editor when using GamepadButtonPropertyDrawer [ISXB-1270](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1270).\n- Fixed an issue causing InvalidOperationException when entering playmode with domain reload disabled. [ISXB-1208](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1208).\n- Fixed an issue where compiling Addressables with Input System package present would result in failed compilation due to `IInputAnalytic.TryGatherData` not being defined [ISXB-1203](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1203).\n- Pinned Touch Samples sample package dependencies to avoid errors with Cinemachine 3.x and Probuilder 6.x. [ISXB-1245](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-1245)\n- Fixed an issue where dropdown menu for Path in Input Actions Editor could not be selected from any button position.
